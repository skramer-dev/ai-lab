Its skin is a light, turquoise color with dark, green spots;Bulbasaur;0
It has three claws on all four of its legs;Bulbasaur;0
Its most notable feature, however, is the aforementioned bulb on its back, which according to its entry in the Pokédex, was planted there at birth;Bulbasaur;0
A Bulbasaur often rests in bright places so its bulb can absorb sunlight;Bulbasaur;0
It can be seen napping in bright sunlight;Bulbasaur;0
While it sleeps, the seed on its back catches the rays and uses the energy to grow;Bulbasaur;0
In the wild, Bulbasaur tend to be very rare, as they are shy creatures that prefer the company of their own kind;Bulbasaur;0
However, they are also generally very docile, tame, and loyal to people that they trust, and for that reason are one of the species of Pokémon available for starting trainers to choose in the region of Kanto;Bulbasaur;0
Each Bulbasaur has a bulb on its back that grows steadily larger as it matures;Bulbasaur;0
This bulb contains a seed which uses photosynthesis to supply Bulbasaur with energy;Bulbasaur;0
Its bulb is also used to store the energy that the seed absorbs, which can be used when it is necessary;Bulbasaur;0
It is assumed that when a Bulbasaur collects enough energy in its bulb, it will evolve into an Ivysaur;Bulbasaur;0
The plants are able to become mobile by virtue of their active hosts, allowing them to move out of shaded areas and thus benefiting them as well;Bulbasaur;0
Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur starting at level 16, and into Venusaur at level 32;Bulbasaur;0
Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches;Bulbasaur;0

As mentioned in the anime, starter Pokémon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers;Bulbasaur;0
Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon;Bulbasaur;0
It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment;Bulbasaur;0

It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region;Bulbasaur;0
However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer;Bulbasaur;0
It has been observed that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve;Bulbasaur;0

Ivysaur's appearance is very similar to that of its pre-evolved form, Bulbasaur;Ivysaur;1
It still retains the turquoise skin and spots, along with its red eyes;Ivysaur;1
Ivysaur's top fangs are now larger and are visible outside of its mouth;Ivysaur;1
Also, its ears are now darkened to black in the center;Ivysaur;1
Carrying the weight of the bud on its back makes Ivysaur's legs stronger;Ivysaur;1
The most notable change is that the bulb is starting to bloom, with pink petals visible, and large leaves on the bloom bottom;Ivysaur;1
Ivysaur are able to naturally learn the powerful Grass-type attack Solar Beam, a move whose execution time depends largely upon the weather it takes an excruciatingly long amount of time to perform this attack in hail, rain, or a sandstorm, but nearly no time at all in bright sunlight;Ivysaur;1
Luckily, the latter is ​most common in the habitats of these Pokémon, as it is vital that the bulbs on their backs receive ample sunlight so that they can photosynthesize and develop;Ivysaur;1
As the bulbs grow larger and these Ivysaur become more powerful, they must spend increasing amounts of time in the sun in order to foster their growth;Ivysaur;1
When Ivysaur are preparing to evolve into Venusaur, they will spend more time sunbathing and their bulbs will begin emanating a sweet, pleasant aroma;Ivysaur;1
Its blossom on its back grows larger in the sunlight;Ivysaur;1
As the blossom grows, Ivysaur loses the ability to stand on its hind legs;Ivysaur;1
The blossom produces a pleasant smell when it is ready to bloom, it means Ivysaur is ready to evolve into Venusaur;Ivysaur;1

Female Venusaur are slightly different because they have a seed on their back, which shows that it can give birth to a new Bulbasaur;Venusaur;2
Female Venusaur have bulbs sticking out of the tops of their flowers;Venusaur;2
Venusaur absorbs sunlight to gain energy and to feed its flower, located on its back;Venusaur;2
After gaining a certain amount of sunlight, the flower will release a sweet aroma said to soothe the emotions of people;Venusaur;2

Inhaling the pollen can cause uncontrollable sneezing, and breathing in too much of it can even cause fainting;Venusaur;2
However, the pollen also stimulates plant growth;Venusaur;2
Places where the pollen falls are said to grow thick with large plants;Venusaur;2
Venusaur are powerful but relatively nonviolent Pokémon;Venusaur;2
Despite their menacing appearances, Venusaur are docile Pokémon, preferring to sunbathe so that the plants on their backs can photosynthesize rather than fight;Venusaur;2
They follow sunny patches that reach the forest floor as the sun moves across the sky;Venusaur;2
With enough solar energy, the flowers on their backs can release a fragrance that calms both hostile Pokémon and people alike;Venusaur;2
The scent also attracts a number of Bug-type Pokémon to the flowers as well to aid in their pollination during the breeding season;Venusaur;2
This ability allows Venusaur to serve as peacekeepers of sorts in their native forests, not only stopping fights that break out in their territories, but also defending their domains from dangers with their might if necessary;Venusaur;2
Female Venusaur have seeds in their flowers, which they plant into the backs of their offspring to grow into new plants;Venusaur;2

In the anime, Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur;Venusaur;2
This Pokémon is rarely found in the wild, but it has been known to inhabit grasslands;Venusaur;2
As Mega Venusaur, the flower on its back grows larger and two smaller pink flowers bloom, one on its forehead and one on its rear;Venusaur;2
Its legs and back have become sturdier to support the extra weight of the flower;Venusaur;2
Additional leaves with woody stems, which are supported by vines, are also grown around the flower;Venusaur;2
Mega Venusaur also develops dark markings on its forehead below the new flower on its forehead;Venusaur;2

Three red clouds surround the main cannon;Blastoise;8
Gigantamax Blastoise can adapt to any situation using various cannon combinations;Blastoise;8
It is not very good at precision shooting, so instead of aiming its attacks, it prefers to overwhelm its opponent by launching dynamic, powerful torrents from its cannons;Blastoise;8
According to one legend, its main cannon is so staggeringly powerful it can blast holes through the mountains;Blastoise;8

Firstly, the large eyes on their heads can trick and confuse predators into thinking they are dealing with much larger Pokémon;Caterpie;9
Secondly, the suction pads on their feet allow them to climb nearly any surface and escape from predators;Caterpie;9
Additionally, Caterpie can use String Shot to slow down their enemies and buy time for escape;Caterpie;9
Finally, the antennae on their heads release a very noxious odor when disturbed;Caterpie;9

Caterpie has the ability Shield Dust, which negates all status effects that are side effects of other moves;Caterpie;9
When threatened, it can release a strong odor from its antenna, which it uses to ward off predators;Caterpie;9
A ravenous Caterpie can quickly gobble up leaves that are much bigger than itself;Caterpie;9
Caterpie evolves into Metapod starting at level 7, which evolves into Butterfree starting at level 10;Caterpie;9

When preparing to evolve, Caterpie spin cocoons around themselves;Metapod;10
These cocoons, while still vulnerable when soft, will eventually harden into iron-hard casings, triggering their evolutions into Metapod;Metapod;10
To avoid attacks, these Pokémon stay motionless and simply ​wait;Metapod;10
Metapod are remarkably patient, enduring whatever pain they must to reach their final stages;Metapod;10
They must remain upright while biding their time or risk spilling out their innards;Metapod;10
They are often regarded as nearly useless in battle, as freshly-caught Metapod are incapable of damaging foes at all (other than by using Struggle);Metapod;10
Luckily, however, the Caterpie line undergoes some of the quickest evolutions known to date, and it does not take very long for Metapod to finally evolve into Butterfree;Metapod;10

Male Kantonian Raichu have tips on their lightning bolt tails while females have flat ends on them;Raichu;25
Unlike their Kantonian counterparts, Alolan Raichu do not sport any visual differences between males and females;Raichu;25
Raichu is more confident, faithful and powerful than Pikachu, which makes them rivals, but sometimes it is just as friendly and cute;Raichu;25
However, if it stores too much electricity in its body, it can become extremely short-tempered and aggressive;Raichu;25
Yet, some of them are timid and will run away from people;Raichu;25
Usually, Alolan Raichu are often more playful than their normal counterparts;Raichu;25
They use their surfboard-like tails to ride waves and to float in mid-air;Raichu;25
When their cheeks are rubbed, they emit both electricity and a sweet-smelling aroma;Raichu;25
Locals of the Alola region often states that Raichu got this change from eating lots of fluffy pancakes, which are a common delicacy in the Alola region;Raichu;25
Raichu can generate electricity through its cheeks and electrocute its opponents;Raichu;25
The highest amount of electricity it can discharge to take down its foes are 100,000 volts;Raichu;25
When or not in battle a Raichu can use its long tail to grab and restrain opponents or hold and carry things seen in PJ018 and PJ036;Raichu;25
Its tail can also serve as a ground to protect itself from high voltage power;Raichu;25
Being part-Psychic-type, Alolan Raichu can also learn Psychic apart from learning Electric type moves;Raichu;25
It can discharge star-shaped thunderbolts;Raichu;25
Able to control psychic powers, Alolan Raichu gathers psykenosis into its tail and uses it to ride around;Raichu;25
When you scrub its cheek pouches, they emit very sweet aroma;Raichu;25
Raichu is the evolved form of Pikachu, and the final evolutionary form of Pichu;Raichu;25
Pikachu can evolve into either form of Raichu by the use of a Thunder Stone, but will only evolve into Alolan Raichu in Sun and Moon (and Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon unless it is evolved in Ultra Space);Raichu;25
Before the release of Pokemon Bank for Sun and Moon, the normal form could not be obtained in either games without trading;Raichu;25
Raichu is a bipedal, rodent-like Pokémon;Raichu;25
Raichu is covered in dark orange fur with a white belly;Raichu;25

Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center;Raichu;25
On its back are two horizontal brown stripes;Raichu;25
Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end;Raichu;25
This lightning bolt is chipped on females;Raichu;25
Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from all its body and glows slightly in the dark;Raichu;25
Raichu's tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity;Raichu;25
It also protects Raichu from its own high voltage power;Raichu;25
Raichu can store over 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out a Copperajah;Raichu;25
If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up and its muscles become stimulated;Raichu;25
However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity and stress;Raichu;25
To keep from reaching this state, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground;Raichu;25
This leads to scorched patches near its nest;Raichu;25
Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone, Raichu is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and woodlands;Raichu;25
The main reason Raichu is rarely seen in the wild is because people prefer the look it had as Pikachu;Raichu;25
In Alola, Raichu has lighter coloring and more rounded features;Raichu;25
Its eyes are blue with yellow half-circles along the bottom;Raichu;25

By collecting its psychic power in its tail, it is able to ride it like a surfboard and float in the air;Raichu;25
While its cheek sacs are still used to store electricity, rubbing them releases a sweet aroma while also getting a light shock;Raichu;25
This is also thought to be connected to its Psychic abilities;Raichu;25
Alolan Raichu's origins were initially a mystery at the time;Raichu;25
The people of Alola suggested it ate too many sweet and fluffy pancakes,1 especially those made with a secret Alolan recipe;Raichu;25
However, researchers believe the change is related to Alolan Raichu's diet in general;Raichu;25
It is also believed the weather and climate of the Alola region played a role in the transformation;Raichu;25
Alolan Raichu is capable of unleashing star-shaped thunderbolts;Raichu;25
It is also known by the name hodad;Raichu;25
Raichu and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle;Raichu;25

Sandshrew has a white belly and a yellow back;Sandshrew;26
Its back resembles bricked pavement or walls;Sandshrew;26
It has a short tail, four short legs and a small head;Sandshrew;26
Sandshrew resembles an armadillo, and can curl into a very tight ball which is about the size of a basketball;Sandshrew;26
Alolan Sandshrew, having fled the desert due to frequent eruptions, has adapted to the cold climate of the snowy mountains;Sandshrew;26
This Sandshrew has a white belly and an ice blue back;Sandshrew;26
Its back resembles bricked pavement or walls albeit colored ice blue;Sandshrew;26
It has a short tail, four short legs and a small head;Sandshrew;26
The majority of its ice blue body is clad in steel-hard ice armor, also sporting the ice brick pattern;Sandshrew;26
Most Sandshrew are timid and they usually run away by digging holes;Sandshrew;26
Despite this nature, they can become braver and more courageous once they're trained by skilled trainers;Sandshrew;26
When their skin becomes wrinkled due to moisture, they head to volcanic areas and dry themselves out through laying on a spot with lots of geothermal heat;Sandshrew;26
They are implied to eat bug types;Sandshrew;26
When some Sandshrew first arrived at the islands of Alola, they tried to scrape out niches in lowland desert areas;Sandshrew;26
However, such places were plagued with frequent volcanic activity in Alola's past, making them unsuitable for most forms of life;Sandshrew;26
Though Sandshrew are somewhat accustomed to geothermic activity, the frequency of such disturbances was so great that were forced to flee to higher ground;Sandshrew;26
Today, Alolan Sandshrew inhabit snowy mountains;Sandshrew;26
Their skin has grown thicker and steel-like to help insulate them from the cold additionally, they are also covered in thin layers of ice;Sandshrew;26
Though this gives them great defensive capabilities, it also hinder their flexibility;Sandshrew;26
Consequently, Alolan Sandshew cannot curl up into balls like their mainland relatives;Sandshrew;26
To move, Alolan Sandshrew slide across slick ice on their bellies like curling stones;Sandshrew;26
A popular competition in Alolan festivals, in fact, is Sandshrew sliding, where contestants try to slide their Pokémon as far down the ice as possible;Sandshrew;26
Alolan Sandshrew also have developed claws that help them cling onto ice without slipping;Sandshrew;26
When attacked, they will hold tight to the slippery ground in order to keep their soft undersides safe from predators;Sandshrew;26
This compact form also keeps them low to the ground and prevents them from being blown about during powerful blizzards;Sandshrew;26
Thier diet is left unspecified;Sandshrew;26
Sandshrew, when in danger, can curl into a ball to defend itself;Sandshrew;26
They can also claw away sharp rock that impede their digging;Sandshrew;26
Alolan Sandshrew lack flexibility and cannot curl into a ball but have an excelling natural defense which makes up for this;Sandshrew;26
They also have natural maneuverability on ice;Sandshrew;26
Sandshrew evolves into Sandslash once it reaches level 22;Sandshrew;26
Alolan Sandshrew evolves into Alolan Sandslash when exposed to an Ice Stone;Sandshrew;26
Sandshrew is a bipedal pholidote Pokémon, but runs on all fours in the anime;Sandshrew;26
Its brick-patterned yellow hide is dry, tough, blends in with desert sand, and protects its soft white underbelly and muzzle;Sandshrew;26
Sandshrew has blue, almond-shaped eyes, a pointed snout, and triangular ears with white insides;Sandshrew;26
Its tail is thick and conical;Sandshrew;26
It has two long claws on each foot and three sharp claws on its forepaws, which are used to burrow;Sandshrew;26
Sandshrew spends much of its time hidden underground in deep burrows;Sandshrew;26
It only emerges to lunge and drag in passing Bug-type Pokémon;Sandshrew;26
Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents, but may also throw sand at attackers;Sandshrew;26
While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in the desert, Sandshrew has been found in caves as well;Sandshrew;26
It also lives deep underground in nests it has created from digging tunnels;Sandshrew;26
Should hard rocks get in the way of digging, Sandshrew will use its sharp claws to remove them before continuing to dig;Sandshrew;26
If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly;Sandshrew;26
It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano;Sandshrew;26
In the Alola region, Sandshrew migrated to snowy mountains due to the volcanic activity near the desert areas;Sandshrew;26
Its body is a light, icy blue, with a cream-colored belly and muzzle;Sandshrew;26
This results in Sandshrew developing a body of ice that is as hard as steel;Sandshrew;26
Thicker plates form a dome around its head and its ears resemble an igloo's entrances;Sandshrew;26
In adapting to this cold climate, its body became larger and heavier with a shell of ice covering its hide;Sandshrew;26
This steel-like covering grants it extra defense from predators like Sneasel, but it is unable to curl into a ball like its desert counterpart;Sandshrew;26
It can burrow itself in the snow to avoid being blown away by blizzards;Sandshrew;26
Predators, such as Weavile, exploit of its soft underbelly;Sandshrew;26
Alolan Sandshrew's claws allow it to move without slipping on icy surfaces, but it slides on its stomach when it needs to move quickly;Sandshrew;26
Sandslash is a tall, yellow, mammalian porcupine-like creature with brown quills on its back;Sandslash;27
It has two very long claws on each hand used for digging and battling;Sandslash;27
Sandslash can curl up to a small size just like its pre-evolved form Sandshrew, but it is of a much larger stature, which enhances its defense;Sandslash;27
Alolan Sandslash keeps the traits of its Alolan pre-evolution;Sandslash;27
It is a tall, ice blue mammalian porcupine-like creature with steel-hard, ice blue crystals on its back;Sandslash;27
It has two very long claws on each hand used for digging paths in the snow;Sandslash;27
The weight of the ice makes it slower than regular Sandslash;Sandslash;27
Sandslash is a resilient creature that lives in desert areas, particularly areas close to dry forests;Sandslash;27
It is commonly seen either climbing up trees or digging into the dusty ground, both activities which it is suited for thanks to its claws;Sandslash;27
However, though its claws are strong, they are not indestructible they occasionally snap when Sandslash digs at an incredibly fast pace;Sandslash;27
The claws will have started to grow back by the next day, though;Sandslash;27
The most notable behavior that Sandslash performs to cope with its environment is its method of curling up its body to become in essence a ball covered with large spikes, much like the hedgehog, armadillo, or pangolin;Sandslash;27
Sandslash rolls up so that the spikes shade its inner body from the sun and therefore prevent heatstroke that can result from the scorching heat that accompanies daytime in the desert;Sandslash;27
Sandslash is a fully-armed predator when dealing with other Pokémon in the desert areas that form its natural environment;Sandslash;27
When attacked, Sandslash rolls up into its spherical guise and its spikes arrange to form its defense, after which the Pokémon will either roll away to escape or roll towards the opponent to attack;Sandslash;27
When trying to flee in this manner, Sandslash exerts specific force on the ground to kick up small-but-blinding dust clouds in its wake, hoping to discourage other Pokémon from following it;Sandslash;27
When attacking in this manner, though, Sandslash proves itself adept at making the opponent flinch with the spikes of its rolling body just before uncoiling itself and hacking with its claws;Sandslash;27
It prefers attacking from higher elevations when targeting prey;Sandslash;27
It uses large, hooked claws to cut a path through deep snow as it runs;Sandslash;27

Sandslash is a bipedal, ground-dwelling pholidote Pokémon;Sandslash;27
Although Sandslash is usually bipedal, it can run on all fours;Sandslash;27
Most of its underside is light yellow with a white underbelly;Sandslash;27
It has a narrow muzzle, almond-shaped blue eyes, and a thick tail;Sandslash;27
Its back is mostly covered in sharp, brown quills formed from its tough, dry hide;Sandslash;27
It has two large claws on its paws and feet;Sandslash;27
These claws are its primary weapons and are used for slashing, but can also be used for burrowing;Sandslash;27
Its claws and spikes can both break off and are shed regularly, but grow back quickly;Sandslash;27
Sandslash's broken parts can be used as carving plows for tilling farm fields;Sandslash;27
The claws can become smoother if it lives in drier areas;Sandslash;27
It can curl into a large ball, which allows it to roll to attack or escape, protect itself from heatstroke, and guard its belly;Sandslash;27
Sandslash is also adept at climbing trees and is prone to ambush its enemies from above;Sandslash;27
It also climbs trees to slash Berries to feed the Sandshrew waiting bellow;Sandslash;27
Sandslash can mostly be found in deserts;Sandslash;27
In the Alola region, Sandslash has an icy blue hide and steel quills covered in ice;Sandslash;27
These quills stand taller than a regular Sandslash's quills and resemble icicles;Sandslash;27
This Pokémon uses its hide for camouflage in the snow while leaving only its spines exposed;Sandslash;27
Unlike its Kantonian variant, the thick hide and icy spines completely prevent Alolan Sandslash from curling up into a ball;Sandslash;27
Its body emits cold air, which sharpens its quills;Sandslash;27
Its forepaws are larger than its counterpart, and its claws are longer, thinner, and hooked at the tips;Sandslash;27
Formerly used for climbing trees, they now allow it to scale icebergs;Sandslash;27
Despite the weight of its ice-covered body, Alolan Sandslash is able to move swiftly by carving a path in the snow with its claws;Sandslash;27
It can move faster than any Pokémon while in the snowy mountains;Sandslash;27
This Pokémon tends to live in the deeper parts of snowy mountains, where climbing is forbidden;Sandslash;27
However, the sprays of snow it kicks up are popular shots for photographers;Sandslash;27
1 People also climb up the mountains it lives in, in order to see Sandslash's icy spikes sparkle during the light of dawn;Sandslash;27

While sleeping, or in colder conditions, Zubat gathers with others of its kind for warmth;Zubat;40
Golbat is a large, blue bat with super long wings;Golbat;41
Unlike its pre-evolved form, named Zubat, Golbat has eyes;Golbat;41
It also has two long, skinny feet;Golbat;41
The most distinct feature of Golbat is its large mouth with four teeth;Golbat;41
A female Golbat has smaller teeth than those of a male's;Golbat;41
Like Zubat, Golbat are found in caves and dark areas worldwide;Golbat;41
Unlike Zubat, however, Golbat are hematophagous, consuming the blood of Pokémon and humans alike;Golbat;41
They use their sharp fangs to puncture the skins of victims;Golbat;41
Their saliva contains a substance that poisons and immobilizes prey, allowing them to drink blood at their leisure;Golbat;41
Golbat can drink up to 10 ounces of blood in one sitting, possibly fatal for smaller victims;Golbat;41
After doing so, however, their flight often becomes clumsy and erratic due to their heavy weights after large meals they may become so heavy that they fall to the ground (and become easy prey themselves);Golbat;41
Luckily, this feasting keeps them satisfied for a while they only search for food during moonless nights when darkness conceals them;Golbat;41
Recently, it has been discovered that Golbat broods will share blood with one another during times of scarcity however, selfish Golbat that do not share blood when asked will find that other brood members will refuse to share with them in the future;Golbat;41
Their fangs are hollow and consequently fragile;Golbat;41
Notably, Golbat avoid light, metal (perhaps due to their poison being ineffective against Steel-types), and oddly enough, Durin Berries;Golbat;41
While no one is quite sure why, Golbat tend to steer clear of them despite experiencing no ill effects upon consuming them;Golbat;41
Surprisingly, Golbat are quite adroit on their oddly-shaped feet, which are adapted to create silent footsteps as they sneak up behind sleeping prey;Golbat;41

It has short legs with long, tiny feet;Golbat;41
Despite this, Golbat can walk skillfully on the ground;Golbat;41
Golbat's fangs have hollow tubes (similar to straws) specialized for sucking blood;Golbat;41
While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile;Golbat;41
There are some Golbat that have missing fangs as a result of their hunger-fueled attempt to try drinking blood from Steel-type Pokémon;Golbat;41
Golbat feeds on the blood of both Pokémon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting;Golbat;41
It is gluttonous, and drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed;Golbat;41
It occasionally gorges itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn;Golbat;41
However, it is also willing to share gathered blood with other members of its kind that are hungry;Golbat;41

On top of its head grows a large clump of five long green leaves;Oddish;42
Oddish is a nocturnal Pokémon, using moonlight rather than the sun's rays for photosynthesis;Oddish;42
During the day, Oddish avoids the sun's heat and brightness by burying itself into the earth, leaving only the leaves on top of its head visible above ground;Oddish;42
This way, it disguises itself as a plant, misdirecting its carnivorous diurnal predators;Oddish;42
While buried, Oddish nourishes itself by absorbing nutrients from the soil using its feet, which are said to temporarily change into a root-like structure for this purpose;Oddish;42
If anyone pulls at Oddish's leaves and tries to uproot it while it is buried underground, Oddish will react by shrieking in a horrible voice;Oddish;42
Once nightfall comes, exposure to moonlight causes Oddish to become much more active;Oddish;42
It extracts itself from the ground, and its extremities change back into the shape of legs;Oddish;42
It then proceeds to bathe itself in the moonlight and grow, as well as wander around scattering its seeds;Oddish;42
With the coming of dawn, the cycle repeats;Oddish;42
Oddish evolves into Gloom at Level 21;Oddish;42
Oddish is a Pokémon that resembles a blue plant bulb or a root vegetable;Oddish;42

Known by the scientific name Oddium Wanderus, Oddish lives in grasslands;Oddish;42
A nocturnal Pokémon, Oddish buries its sensitive body in the ground during the day to avoid the sun and fool predators;Oddish;42
If its leaves are pulled in this state, it will respond by shrieking horribly;Oddish;42
It starts to move when its leaves begin absorbing moonlight, which it uses to grow;Oddish;42
Oddish will wander up to 1,000 feet (300 meters) during the night to scatter its seeds and find a nutrient-rich patch of soil in which to plant itself;Oddish;42
The more fertile the earth, the glossier its leaves will be;Oddish;42
It is thought that its feet become like tree roots while planted;Oddish;42

Both this nectar and the flower on Gloom's head release a foul odor strong enough to induce fainting in humans over a mile (1;Gloom;43
6 kilometers) away;Gloom;43
However, it can also attract prey, and even a very small number of humans find it pleasing;Gloom;43
This odor is a key ingredient for some perfume production;Gloom;43
When it is in danger, the odor worsens, but it will not emit its odor if it feels safe;Gloom;43
Gloom lives in grassy plains;Gloom;43
In Generation I, Petal Dance was its signature move;Gloom;43
Vileplume is purple in color with red eyes and four short limbs;Vileplume;44
There is also a rafflesia on its head, which is a type of flower known to have a putrid smell;Vileplume;44
Female Vileplumes have larger and fewer spots on their petals;Vileplume;44
The smell of the flowers attracts prey when they draw close, Vileplume flap their petals, cloaking themselves and their targets in toxic pollen that quickly immobilizes victims;Vileplume;44
Even as they walk, Vileplume scatter pollen out of their blooms, turning the surrounding air a sickly yellow;Vileplume;44
This pollen can cause poisoning and paralysis in large amounts, but can also trigger massive allergy attacks in even trace amounts;Vileplume;44
Like Oddish and Gloom, Vileplume may hide partially buried in the soil, only exposing their flowers for unwary prey to investigate;Vileplume;44
Because of this, it is inadvisable to approach large flowers in swamps or jungles, as they may actually be Vileplume in disguise waiting for an opportunity to scatter pollen;Vileplume;44
Vileplume are known for their large flower;Vileplume;44
The flower releases a large amount of pollen in the air when it is flapped;Vileplume;44

The rounded petals of the flower are red and covered with white spots;Vileplume;44
A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals;Vileplume;44
Vileplume can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen;Vileplume;44
This pollen is yellow and highly allergenic to humans, and toxic to other Pokémon Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey before devouring it;Vileplume;44
The larger the Vileplume's petals are, the more potent the toxin on its pollen is;Vileplume;44
Vileplume's behavior of flapping its petals also makes very loud noises;Vileplume;44
In Generation I, Petal Dance was its signature move;Vileplume;44

Galarian Slowpoke used to eat the seeds of a certain plant that grew in their habitat;Slowpoke;78
These seeds were in fact Galarica seeds, used to this day as an essential spice for cooking in the Galar region;Slowpoke;78
The Slowpoke in Galar built up particles of this spice in their bodies over several generations, eventually gaining the unique appearance and behavior they are known for today;Slowpoke;78
Galarian Slowpoke spend their days wallowing on seashores and riverbanks without thinking about anything in particular;Slowpoke;78
Occasionally, they might get a very sharp look in their eyes, but they will soon revert to their zoned-out expression;Slowpoke;78
It is thought that this behavior is caused by the accumulated Galarica particles stimulating Galarian Slowpoke's brain, resulting in it thinking of something tremendous—only for the Galarian Slowpoke to immediately forget what it had just thought of;Slowpoke;78
It is said that Galarian Slowpoke love Galarica Cuffs and Galarica Wreaths;Slowpoke;78
Slowpoke evolves into Slowbro at level 37, or into Slowking when traded while holding a King's Rock;Slowpoke;78
In the anime, Slowpoke's evolution is quite different;Slowpoke;78
To become Slowbro a Shellder must latch onto Slowpokes tail;Slowpoke;78
To become a Slowking, a Slowpoke must put on a King's Rock and have a Shellder clamp onto it;Slowpoke;78
Galarian Slowbro evolves into Galarian Slowbro by being given a Galarica Cuff, or Galarian Slowking by being given a Galarica Wreath;Slowpoke;78
Slowpoke is a pink Pokémon that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus;Slowpoke;78
It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle;Slowpoke;78
It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw;Slowpoke;78
Its long, tapering tail has a white tip;Slowpoke;78
This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish;Slowpoke;78
Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure;Slowpoke;78
The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back;Slowpoke;78
Slowpoke tails are considered a delicacy and commonly used as a cooking ingredient: in Alola, they are often dried and used in home-cooked stews, while in Galar, they are smoked and packaged as a curry ingredient;Slowpoke;78
Slowpoke is also known to dive underwater to hunt, but is often itself caught instead;Slowpoke;78
Slowpoke has a notoriously dim intellect and often forgets what it was doing;Slowpoke;78
It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli;Slowpoke;78
For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten;Slowpoke;78
Slowpoke is commonly found at the water's edge;Slowpoke;78
In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke's yawn causes rain;Slowpoke;78
This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas;Slowpoke;78
Its vacant expression is said to help some people relax, whilst causing irritation to others;Slowpoke;78
It is posited that those who lead hectic lives are most likely to become relaxed;Slowpoke;78
Galarian Slowpoke's body is a slightly different shade of pink, and it has gained yellow colorations on its forehead and tail;Slowpoke;78
This tail is always down and said to have a spicy taste;Slowpoke;78
Much like its Kantonian counterpart, Galarian Slowpoke are known to relax on seashores and riverbanks without a care in the world;Slowpoke;78
However, sometimes it will get a very sharp look in its eyes as if it is about to think of something tremendous, although it will quickly forget and return to its normal expression afterward;Slowpoke;78
It is believed that this behavior, along with the spicy taste of its tail, is a result of Galarica particles built up from its diet of native Galarica seeds affecting its brain and body;Slowpoke;78
1 This diet also affects Slowpoke's two different evolutions, including the Shellder that attaches to it, which is induced by either the Galarica Cuff or the Galarica Wreath;Slowpoke;78
Slowbro is a bipedal, pink Pokémon with a tan, striped belly and a tan muzzle;Slowbro;79
It has large, vacant eyes, curled ears, and two pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw;Slowbro;79
On its hands, it has three clawed fingers, and two clawed toes on its feet;Slowbro;79
There is aShellderattached to its tail;Slowbro;79
This Shellder has a gray, spiraled shell with darker gray spots;Slowbro;79
There are several spikes across the surface of the Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth;Slowbro;79
When Slowbro Mega Evolves into Mega Slowbro, it becomes engulfed by the Shellder to the point where only its head, arms and tail are visible;Slowbro;79
The spiral Shellder now has an opening at its tip, allowing the tail of Slowbro to stick out, which it balances on due to its legs being engulfed;Slowbro;79
The spikes on the Shellder are now reduced to four on the bottom section of its body, with the dark spots only visible on its middle section;Slowbro;79
The Galarian form of Slowbro has purple markings on its upper head and ears, tail, and arms;Slowbro;79
The Shellder that attaches to Kantonian Slowbro's tail is on Slowbro's left arm instead, being more similar to an arm cannon;Slowbro;79
The spikes on Shellder are larger and more conical;Slowbro;79
Kantonian Slowbro is typically rather lazy and unintelligent, but when the Shellder bites down on its tail (causing more venom to head to the brain), it becomes inspired for some reason;Slowbro;79
It is very peaceful and avoids confrontation most of the time;Slowbro;79
Slowbro are no longer able to fish with their tails and must, to their disdain, swim to catch food;Slowbro;79
Galarian Slowbro is more aggressive as the Shellder biting down on its arm causes it to Attack everything indiscriminately, While normally zoned out, it gets rather serious due to a stimulus jolt;Slowbro;79
The two organisms have some autonomy in controlling how Galarian Slowbro acts;Slowbro;79
By squeezing their Shellder's tongues, these Pokémon can cause them to shoot out a toxin liquid from the tips of their shells;Slowbro;79
However, the Shellder can also bite down when they sense danger, triggering their hosts to swing around the arms wildly while shooting toxins to both smash and poison indiscriminately;Slowbro;79
Because of this, these Pokémon can be quite dangerous to be around;Slowbro;79
By injecting venom into their bloodstreams (either by the parasite's or the host's volition), Galarian Slowbro can drastically sharpen their senses thanks to the venom's reaction with galaricin;Slowbro;79
This makes them incredibly quick on the draw, shooting enemies with great accuracy before they even prepare to attack;Slowbro;79
Kantonian Slowbro is implied to be able to use powerful psychic attacks it only uses when forced to;Slowbro;79
It is also somehow insensitive to pain due to Shellder biting on it, tying into its oblivious and own tempo abilities (which ignores infatuation and confusion);Slowbro;79
It hidden ability, regenerator, heals its slightly when withdrawn from battle;Slowbro;79
Mega Slowbro's Shellder has become armor that is unscratchable, reflected in its Shell armor ability (which prevents critical hits on it), while it can move by jumping on its tail like a spring;Slowbro;79
The Slowpoke involved is virtually unchanged, aside from becoming stronger and more motivated;Slowbro;79
Galarian Slowbro are surprisingly fast, reflected in their signature Quick Draw ability (which gives it chance to strike first);Slowbro;79
Their primary Attack method is shooting poison from its Shellder by pulling in the tongue of the latter;Slowbro;79
Slowbro evolves from Slowpoke starting at level 37;Slowbro;79
Since Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, it can Mega Evolve into Mega Slowbro using its Mega Stone, Slowbronite;Slowbro;79
Galarian Slowpoke evolves into Galarian Slowbro using a Galarica Cuff;Slowbro;79
In the anime, Slowpoke evolves into Slowbro when a Shellder bites its tail;Slowbro;79
Slowking is an alternate evolution that happens when a Shellder clamps its head while wearing a King's Rock;Slowbro;79
Slowbro is a bipedal, pink Pokémon with a tan, striped belly and a rounded, tan muzzle;Slowbro;79
It has large, vacant eyes, curled ears, and two small pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw;Slowbro;79
It has three clawed fingers on its hands and two clawed toes on its feet;Slowbro;79
There is a Shellder attached to its tail;Slowbro;79
This Shellder has a gray, spiral shell with darker gray spots and small, triangular eyes near the base;Slowbro;79
There are several spikes across the surface of the Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth;Slowbro;79
Shellder developed its spiral form in an effort to suck more sweetness out of Slowbro's tail;Slowbro;79
If its tail or the Shellder attached to it is broken off, Slowbro will revert to its unevolved form, Slowpoke;Slowbro;79
Slowbro has lost the capability to feel pain due to the Shellder's poison;Slowbro;79
While typically lazy and unintelligent, Slowbro apparently becomes inspired when the Shellder bites down on its tail;Slowbro;79
While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, Slowbro is typically rather peaceful and usually prefers not to fight;Slowbro;79
Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it instead swims to catch its prey and allows the Shellder to feed on its leftover scraps;Slowbro;79
Slowbro tends to live near ponds, lakes, and seashores;Slowbro;79
When Slowbro Mega Evolves, it becomes engulfed by the Shellder so that only its head, arms, and white-tipped tail are visible;Slowbro;79
Its head pokes out of the Shellder's mouth and is surrounded by the Shellder's enlarged teeth;Slowbro;79
The Shellder has holes on its sides and an opening at its tip, allowing Mega Slowbro's arms and tail to stick out;Slowbro;79
Mega Slowbro balances on its tail due to its legs being engulfed;Slowbro;79
It can move by bouncing, using its tail as a spring;Slowbro;79
The spikes on the Shellder are now reduced to four on the bottom section of its body and the dark spots only visible on its middle section;Slowbro;79
Mega Slowbro's energy has gathered into Shellder, which has increased its hardness;Slowbro;79
This allows it to act as armor so hard that nothing can scratch it;Slowbro;79
The Slowbro inside is virtually unchanged, but it gains some power and motivation from Shellder's digestive fluids;Slowbro;79
In Galar, Galarian Slowbro's appearance is due to Shellder biting Galarian Slowpoke's arm instead of its tail, causing a chemical reaction between the Shellder's poison and the consumed Galarica spices within the Slowpoke's body;Slowbro;79
1 The Shellder attached to its arm resembles the Shellder tail of its Kantonian counterpart but smaller, with a purple tip shaped like a stinger;Slowbro;79
Galarian Slowbro itself has a slight color difference compared to its counterpart, with purple accents on its head, arms and tail;Slowbro;79
Galarian Slowbro are considered highly dangerous for its tendency to indiscriminately attack its surroundings, the reason for which is due to its Shellder sometimes unconsciously biting down hard on its arm;Slowbro;79
While normally zoned out, when facing a strong opponent its body becomes stimulated, and it will sport a sharper expression;Slowbro;79
Galarian Slowbro attacks by grabbing at its Shellder's tongue, causing the Shellder to fire poisonous liquids from its tip;Slowbro;79
It attacks at speeds rivaling the quickest of known reflexes;Slowbro;79
Galarian Slowbro is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shell Side Arm;Slowbro;79
Magnemite has light bluish-gray steel body in the shape of a sphere which is kept bound together with the two screws and one large screw at the top of its head;Magnemite;80
It has one big eye that is as big as the magnets it uses which can launch electric attacks;Magnemite;80
On the side of its body are two horseshoe magnets which expel antigravity, allowing it to float in mid-air;Magnemite;80
Magnemite emit electromagnetic energy from its horseshoe magnets in order to keep afloat;Magnemite;80
It consumes electricity by attaching itself to power lines;Magnemite;80
During power outages, people would often find large groups of Magnemites congregating inside of circuit breakers;Magnemite;80
If a Magnemite runs low on its electrical energy supply, it would be rendered incapable of flight (but can be recharged by batteries);Magnemite;80
It is normally pacifistic and would mostly only retaliate with non-damaging moves;Magnemite;80
Under the guidance of a Pokémon Trainer, they can become devoted fighters (though the bond needs to be strong enough first);Magnemite;80
Magnemite dislikes some sort of signal that Power Stations use to repel them, and are sensitive to geomagnetic storms accodring to PJ093 that can induce them to gather together akin to Wishiwashi's Schooling ability;Magnemite;80
The units at its sides generate electromagnetic waves that keep it airborne;Magnemite;80
It also feeds on electricity;Magnemite;80
Magnemite evolves into Magneton at level 30;Magnemite;80
Magnemite is a seemingly robotic Pokémon that has a gray, spherical metal body with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye;Magnemite;80
It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna;Magnemite;80
The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head;Magnemite;80
Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, the anime has shown that it has emotions and a way of reproducing;Magnemite;80
It has even exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrients is electrical currents;Magnemite;80
It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field;Magnemite;80
Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph;Magnemite;80
It has also been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years;Magnemite;80
The magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment;Magnemite;80
Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice;Magnemite;80
If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction;Magnemite;80
However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves;Magnemite;80
In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter;Magnemite;80
However, it has been demonstrated that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer;Magnemite;80
Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground;Magnemite;80
Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again;Magnemite;80
Magnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pokétch;Magnemite;80
It has even been shown to be attracted to electric Pokémon producing such fields;Magnemite;80
With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased;Magnemite;80
To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off;Magnemite;80
Magneton is simply the result of three Magnemite linked together through a strong, magnetic force;Magneton;81
The Magnemite that make up Magneton are usually linked together in a triangle formation (with two on the bottom and one on top);Magneton;81
However, some 3-D games (usually the Stadium series) depict Magneton as three separate Magnemite;Magneton;81
Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that holds it together;Magneton;81
Similar to its pre-evolved form, Magnemite, Magneton is able use electromagnetism to levitate and move around;Magneton;81
The electromagnetic energy that Magneton emits is so strong that any nearby electronic devices would be fatally damaged in fact, the strength of Magneton's electromagnetic powers are three times more stronger than Magnemite's;Magneton;81
Another dangerous side effect of Magneton's strong electromagnetic force is creating black outs in many cities because of this, many cities forbid any Trainer from letting Magneton out of its Poké Ball;Magneton;81
At high voltage, Magneton can release stronger waves of electromagnetic energy and radio waves that can increase temperatures up to 3;Magneton;81
6 degrees Fahrenheit with a nearby 3,300-ft;Magneton;81
radius;Magneton;81
It is also able to cause earaches to anyone that gets too close to it;Magneton;81
Magneton usually appear frequently whenever sunspots flare up;Magneton;81
The abilities that Magneton can have are Sturdy or Magnet Pull;Magneton;81
Sturdy prevents any OHKO moves from hitting Magneton;Magneton;81
Magnet Pull prevents any Steel-type Pokémon from escaping battle;Magneton;81
Magneton, along with its evolution family, is the only Electric Pokémon that can learn Zap Cannon via leveling up;Magneton;81
Magneton is the evolved form of Magnemite;Magneton;81
It evolves into Magnezone by leveling up in a location with a special magnetic field (before Generation VIII) or being exposed to a Thunder Stone (Generation VIII);Magneton;81
Magneton is a robot-like Pokémon, the result of three Magnemite becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when no other Magnemite are in the vicinity;Magneton;81
Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side;Magneton;81
The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two;Magneton;81
The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways;Magneton;81
Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle;Magneton;81
In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pokémon Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns;Magneton;81
In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws;Magneton;81
The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3;Magneton;81
6°F (2°C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (1,000 meters);Magneton;81
It can also be disruptive to electronic devices;Magneton;81
It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area;Magneton;81
Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent;Magneton;81
Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still has the need to eat;Magneton;81
As seen in the anime, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents;Magneton;81
It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants;Magneton;81
When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field;Magneton;81
When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes;Magneton;81
As seen in Pokémon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers;Magneton;81
Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph, and one was shown in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years;Magneton;81
A Galarian Farfetch'd (left) and Kantonian Farfetch'd (right);Farfetch'd;82
Farfetch'd is an avian Pokémon that bears a resemblance to a duck;Farfetch'd;82
It is brown in color contrasted with a yellow bill and white underbelly;Farfetch'd;82
The wings of a Farfetch'd show a dexterous quality, as they are equally adapted to manipulate objects much like hands in addition of being used for flight;Farfetch'd;82
Farfetch'd has webbed feet, a characteristic common with most ducks;Farfetch'd;82
Its face is adorned with a black V-shaped marking along with a trio of feathers that crown its head;Farfetch'd;82
It is also holding a leek stalk, which it brandishes as a weapon;Farfetch'd;82
Galarian Farfetch'd have darker brown feathers and carry a larger leek;Farfetch'd;82
It also has a more serious expression;Farfetch'd;82
They can't live without the leeks they hold and that's why they defend their leeks from attackers with their lives;Farfetch'd;82
They won't eat their leeks even in intense hunger, as seen by Goh's Farfetch'd;Farfetch'd;82
They protect the fields in which these plants grow with their dedication, and will often fight with each other for choice stalks;Farfetch'd;82
Their wings have adapted to be more finger-like to enable them to grasp leeks, though some prefer hold them in their beaks instead;Farfetch'd;82
Farfetch’d may actually eat their own leeks though;Farfetch'd;82
They will begin search endlessly for new ones immediately afterwards, however;Farfetch'd;82
Galarian Farfetch'd are rather strong, able to tug around much bigger leeks than their Kantonian Forms;Farfetch'd;82
They can be seen sparring with one another to practice their skills, and are particularly fond of one-on-one duels;Farfetch'd;82
Both forms of Farfetch'd can use their leeks as their melee weapon to defend themselves;Farfetch'd;82
Their stalks enable them to use slashing moves such as Night Slash, False Swipe, and Aerial Ace different fighting styles have been observed in different regions;Farfetch'd;82
Farfetch’d are also surprisingly adept in water, thanks to their webbed feet, and can sometimes be found swimming in ponds;Farfetch'd;82
Prior to Generation VIII, Farfetch'd did not evolve;Farfetch'd;82
It was (before the release of Sirfetch'd) the first Pokémon in the Pokédex that does not evolve into or evolve from anything;Farfetch'd;82
To evolve into Sirfetch'd, Galarian Farfetch'd must land 3 critical hits in the same battle;Farfetch'd;82
Farfetch'd is an avian Pokémon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly;Farfetch'd;82
It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead (similar to a unibrow), and a three-feather crest on top of its head;Farfetch'd;82
Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands;Farfetch'd;82
It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail;Farfetch'd;82
Farfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion;Farfetch'd;82
It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead;Farfetch'd;82
Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life;Farfetch'd;82
Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it;Farfetch'd;82
Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source;Farfetch'd;82
When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things;Farfetch'd;82
There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek;Farfetch'd;82
It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones;Farfetch'd;82
Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them;Farfetch'd;82
However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction;Farfetch'd;82
According to sources such as the anime and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek;Farfetch'd;82
There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population;Farfetch'd;82
In Galar, Farfetch'd has a slightly different look;Farfetch'd;82
Galarian Farfetch'd is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head;Farfetch'd;82
The leek it carries with its wings is much larger in Galar than the leeks that Farfetch'd use in other regions, although whether it is related to the Large Leek used as a curry ingredient is unknown;Farfetch'd;82
Galarian Farfetch'd's body has developed a much stronger frame that gives it the strength required to carry its leek;Farfetch'd;82
However, this sheer mass makes it hard for it to fly;Farfetch'd;82
It is renowned for its courage in battle and can use its leek like swords or javelins;Farfetch'd;82
As a result of surviving and experiencing many different battles, Galarian Farfetch'd develops the ability to evolve into Sirfetch'd;Farfetch'd;82
Farfetch'd and its Galarian evolved form are the only known Pokémon capable of using the Leek item;Farfetch'd;82
Doduo is a tall, bird Pokémon resembling an ostrich;Doduo;83
It has two heads that are exactly identical;Doduo;83
Doduo is covered in brown down and has large taloned feet;Doduo;83
The difference between a male and female Doduo is their necks;Doduo;83
Male Doduo have black necks while females have beige necks;Doduo;83
Doduo alternately bob their heads to keep balance while running;Doduo;83
Their two heads have identical brains (though a few with differing ones have been discovered on occasion) and can communicate ​with each other through telepathy in order to accomplish common goals;Doduo;83
The two heads take turns sleeping while one dozes off, the other keeps watch for any potential dangers approaching;Doduo;83
This team effort makes it difficult to catch Doduo off-guard;Doduo;83
To defend themselves, Doduo can attack with moves such as Double Hit and Drill Peck;Doduo;83
They are able to use both heads at once for some moves, effectively being able to target two enemies at the same time if necessary;Doduo;83
Doduo can run very fast however, they can't fly very well;Doduo;83
Doduo evolves into Dodrio at level 31;Doduo;83
Doduo is a two-headed, bipedal avian Pokémon;Doduo;83
Each head has a long sharp beak and two beady black eyes;Doduo;83
It has a bristly, down-like covering of brown feathers on its body and both heads;Doduo;83
A male has black flexible necks, whereas a female has brown necks both genders have brown legs;Doduo;83
Each foot has four digits ending in a sharp claw;Doduo;83
Both heads have an identical brain;Doduo;83
However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different brains;Doduo;83
It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy for coordination;Doduo;83
Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is always awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies;Doduo;83
Due to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well;Doduo;83
However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner;Doduo;83
Reaching speeds of 60 mph (100 km/h), it energetically strides across the plains leaving large 4 inch (10 centimeter) deep footprints behind it;Doduo;83
By raising and lowering its two heads, it is better able to maintain balance while running;Doduo;83
Doduo lives in wide open plains, grasslands, and savannahs;Doduo;83
Dodrio is an ostrich-like Pokémon;Dodrio;84
It has three heads that each have a black V-shaped crest on top;Dodrio;84
Its body is nearly all covered in brown down;Dodrio;84
It has large clawed feet;Dodrio;84
Its tail is made up of large red feathers;Dodrio;84
Even though no wings are seen it is still part Flying type;Dodrio;84
Unlike its pre-evolved form named Doduo, the faces on Dodrio's faces look different, with each one representing an emotion: joy, sadness, and anger;Dodrio;84
Like Doduo, the males have black necks while the females have beige necks;Dodrio;84
Each head controls a different basic emotion one expresses joy, one sadness, and one anger;Dodrio;84
They can also use their three heads to conceive complex plans to search for food or defend themselves;Dodrio;84
However, they may occasionally over-exhaust themselves with this, and will remain motionless for extended periods of time while recovering;Dodrio;84
Their heads do argue sometimes, since the emotions they control tend to disagree;Dodrio;84
However, like many internal conflicts, these inner spats are usually solved with food;Dodrio;84
Since they share the same stomach, when one of the heads eats, the other two will be satisfied as well;Dodrio;84
Those who live near Dodrio may be woken up early in the morning by their raucous calls—they squawk at the same time every day without fail;Dodrio;84
Dodrio can have the ability Run Away or the ability Early Bird;Dodrio;84
Run Away lets Dodrio flee from any wild Pokémon;Dodrio;84
Early Bird allows Dodrio to wake up faster from the Sleep status;Dodrio;84
Each of its three heads represents an emotion;Dodrio;84
Dodrio's heads represent happiness, sadness, and anger;Dodrio;84
They are capable of running over 40 MPH;Dodrio;84
Dodrio is the evolved form of Doduo as of level 31;Dodrio;84
Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pokémon;Dodrio;84
Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest;Dodrio;84
It has bristly brown feathers covering its heads and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers;Dodrio;84
Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips;Dodrio;84
Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back;Dodrio;84
A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks both genders have brown legs;Dodrio;84
Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality;Dodrio;84
Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy;Dodrio;84
Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies;Dodrio;84
However, on occasion it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever;Dodrio;84
Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat;Dodrio;84
This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting;Dodrio;84
Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times;Dodrio;84
Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions;Dodrio;84
It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking;Dodrio;84
Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well;Dodrio;84
This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest;Dodrio;84
It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall;Dodrio;84
Seel is achubby pinnipedPokémon with a thick, fatty hide covered in bluish white fur;Seel;85
It has a pale tan maw with a large red tongue and a pair of tusks on its lower jaw;Seel;85
It has circular eyes and a black nose that is capable of closing when it swims;Seel;85
There is a small horn on its forehead, which it uses in combination with its tusks to bore through ice floes;Seel;85
It has two flippers on its chest, and two more on the end of its tail;Seel;85
When the tail is raised, it resembles a waterspout;Seel;85
Seel are vespertine Pokémon that are most active in the evening;Seel;85
Sometimes, one may see a Seel napping near the shoreline in the morning;Seel;85
When hunting, they dive underwater for extended periods of time;Seel;85
When they need to breathe, they surface and break through sea ice with their horns (and tusks if necessary);Seel;85
When Seel swim, they close their nostrils tightly to block out water;Seel;85
They are highly social Pokémon, living in large, raucous groups on ice floes in the middle of the sea;Seel;85
Seel may play-fight with each other on these floes, sparring with their tusks and horns as well as Water-type and sometimes Ice-type attacks;Seel;85
This activity is important in teaching young Seel how to defend themselves against enemies;Seel;85
The horns atop their heads can break solid ice;Seel;85
They can survive sub-zero temperatures;Seel;85
Seel evolves into Dewgong at level 34;Seel;85
Seel is a pinniped Pokémon with a thick hide covered in bluish-white fur;Seel;85
It has a pale tan maw with a large red tongue and a pair of tusks on its lower jaw;Seel;85
It has circular eyes and a black nose that is capable of closing when it swims;Seel;85
There is a small horn on its forehead, which it uses in combination with its tusks to bore through ice floes;Seel;85
It has two flippers on its chest, and two more on the end of its tail;Seel;85
When the tail is raised, it resembles a waterspout;Seel;85
Seel lives on icebergs in frigid ocean waters;Seel;85
Its warm fur and thick hide allow it to swim in waters as cold as -40° Fahrenheit (-40° Celsius);Seel;85
It thrives in these cold environments, becoming more active as the temperature drops and tires easily in warm waters;Seel;85
Preferring to sleep during the day, it hunts for prey under sheets of ice in the late day and evening hours;Seel;85
While it is a graceful swimmer, it is awkward and struggles to move on dry land;Seel;85
Dewgong is a long, somewhat plump, completely white Pokémon;Dewgong;86
It has billowing fins;Dewgong;86
There is also a horn on its head that is useful for bashing through thick ice;Dewgong;86
It is somewhat just a more elegant version of Seel;Dewgong;86
Like Seel, Dewgong prefer frigid waters;Dewgong;86
They can swim at a steady 8 knots, undeterred by the cooler temperatures around them;Dewgong;86
In fact, like their pre-evolutions, Dewgong become more active in colder waters;Dewgong;86
When resting, though they do still sometimes sleep on the ocean floor or shore like Seel, they now prefer to rest on ice floes;Dewgong;86
Recent studies show that they are in fact sunbathing while doing so, with the increased temperature aiding their digestion;Dewgong;86
There, their pristine white fur can camouflage them against predators;Dewgong;86
Dewgong no longer use their tusks and horns to play-fight, since they stop growing at this stage;Dewgong;86
However, they are still useful for poking breathing holes into ice floes while swimming under them to resurface for air;Dewgong;86
Dewgong are well-adapted to the frigid temperatures of their environment;Dewgong;86
Dewgong is the evolved form of Seel, as of level 34;Dewgong;86
Dewgong is a pinniped Pokémon with a snowy white, furry body;Dewgong;86
Its fur renders it virtually invisible in snowy conditions;Dewgong;86
Its face has two black eyes, a black nose, and two tusks extending from its upper jaw;Dewgong;86
It has a streamlined body with two front flippers and a long flowing tail;Dewgong;86
Even in extremely cold and ice-packed waters, its tail allows it to be a swift and agile swimmer at speeds of 8 knots;Dewgong;86
On top of its head is a sharp horn, which allows it to cut through the thickest ice floes;Dewgong;86
It lives on icebergs adrift in frigid ocean waters;Dewgong;86
It thrives in lower temperatures, becoming increasingly more active the colder the weather;Dewgong;86
By storing thermal energy within its body, it is completely unharmed by even the most intense freezing weather;Dewgong;86
During daylight hours, it sleeps on bitterly cold ice or under shallow water;Dewgong;86
However, at night when the temperature drops, it becomes a hunter and searches for prey such as Wishiwashi;Dewgong;86
Following a meal, it sunbathes on the beach;Dewgong;86
This raises its body temperature and aids in digestion;Dewgong;86
Grimer was created when sludge in a dirty stream was exposed to the moon's X-rays;Grimer;87
It is composed primarily of putrid, hardened sludge and grime;Grimer;87
It smells incredibly foul, and can influence the abandonment of entire cities due to its polluting nature－even weeds don't grow where a Grimer has appeared;Grimer;87
Grimer thrives in filthy areas, such as factories, garbage dumps, sewers and polluted water systems;Grimer;87
It survives and matures by sucking up polluted sludge that is pumped out of factories, adding toxic waste to its already toxic girth;Grimer;87
Alolan Grimer's body structure is largely the same as Kantonian Grimer, though its appearance is different;Grimer;87
It has a dark green body with a yellow streak across its lower lip that extends all around its head;Grimer;87
It also has black space around its eyes;Grimer;87
Inside its mouth is a blue tongue with two teeth, which are actually crystallized toxins that are highly dangerous to touch;Grimer;87
It enters sewers and other areas with great ease due to its rubbery, semi-viscous body for example, it can enter barred-off areas by slipping between the narrow bars;Grimer;87
If one stick his/her hand in a Grimer, it will be very hard to get it out;Grimer;87
An Alolan Grimer is brought to the Alolan region to deal with the increase of garbage, as well as keeping the Trubbish and Garbodor populations in check;Grimer;87
It has adapted into eating solid waste instead of liquid waste;Grimer;87
Grimer has a huge obsession of garbage, eating huge amounts at a fast pace eating garbage constantly has caused Grimer to form crystallized toxins in its mouth;Grimer;87
Grimer can have the ability Stench or the ability Sticky Hold;Grimer;87
Stench decreases the chances of encountering a wild Pokémon when Grimer is the first party Pokémon;Grimer;87
Sticky Hold prevents the theft of Grimer's held item;Grimer;87
Grimer evolves into Muk at level 38;Grimer;87
Grimer is a slimy, amorphous Pokémon, born from sludge in dirty streams or seabeds that are exposed to lunar radiation;Grimer;87
It has two large eyes with beady pupils and a gaping mouth with a gray tongue;Grimer;87
While it lacks any visible legs, it does have two arms with three digits on each hand;Grimer;87
Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life;Grimer;87
It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body;Grimer;87
Should it run out of internal germs, Grimer will die;Grimer;87
Pieces of it often break off during travel and go on to become new Grimer;Grimer;87
When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds;Grimer;87
Due to its lack of a solid form, Grimer is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease;Grimer;87
It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy wastewater inside;Grimer;87
Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste, which is Grimer's main diet;Grimer;87
It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found;Grimer;87
In recent years, thanks to efforts in environmental improvements and a decrease in their food source of waste, Grimer is now facing extinction;Grimer;87
Grimer was brought to Alola to deal with the excess waste generated by the region's increased population;Grimer;87
Alolan Grimer eats solid garbage instead of sludge this new diet has caused its body composition and form to change;Grimer;87
Alolan Grimer's body is green with a line of yellow sludge along its lower lip that extends around behind its head, a bright blue tongue, and small black crescent-shaped spaces behind its eyes;Grimer;87
It also has two blunt teeth in its upper jaw, which are actually crystallized toxins formed by its diet;Grimer;87
It is not known how to break down these toxic crystals, but direct contact with them is known to be dangerous;Grimer;87
Lethal poisons leak out of Alolan Grimer's body when these crystals fall out;Grimer;87
Because it produces and stores its toxins within its body, Alolan Grimer does not produce a foul stench like Kantonian Grimer;Grimer;87
There are usually about one hundred Alolan Grimer found living near waste-disposal sites in Alola, assisting people in dealing with garbage;Grimer;87
Alolan Grimer is perpetually hungry and must constantly eat trash;Grimer;87
If no trash is readily available, it will eat other manufactured products instead;Grimer;87
In addition to garbage, Alolan Grimer preys on Trubbish and Garbodor its introduction to Alola caused their populations to decrease in the region;Grimer;87
Muk is a large purple mass of sludge, toxic fluids, and other filthy materials;Muk;88
It has two large arms that capture the prey and its eyes are barely visible through the sludge;Muk;88
In Alola, Muk's appearance changes drastically;Muk;88
Rather than being just purple, Alolan Muk is a mixture of bright color tones that consist of pink, green, and yellow with dark blue streaks separating each color this gives Muk the appearance of an oil slick;Muk;88
In addition, crystals formed by solidified toxins cover most of Muk's mouth and hands that gives Muk the appearance of having claws and sharp teeth;Muk;88
In terms of both body size and weight, a Kantonian Muk is larger but lighter while an Alolan Muk is smaller but heavier;Muk;88
Muk's body contains highly noxious chemicals that can cause anyone nearby to faint;Muk;88
These chemicals also cause plant life to wither and die;Muk;88
Due to their ability to create pollution, Muk have been victims of extermination some theorized that because of this, Muk would become extinct in the near future;Muk;88
To counteract this problem, people create sludge pools for Muks to live in;Muk;88
Alolan Muk, unlike its Kantonian counterpart, produces no foul-smelling odors;Muk;88
Instead, all of the odors are stored within Muk's body and are in turn hardened into crystal-like structures covering its mouth and body the crystals will break apart and release dangerous toxins if removed;Muk;88
The reason why Alolan Muk gains its bright coloration is the large quantities of trash it consumes;Muk;88
Alolan Muk's body contains numerous types of poison;Muk;88
It also preys on Trubbish and Garbodor;Muk;88
Although usually friendly and laidback, an Alolan Muk would consume and destroy its trainer's household items if left unfed for a prolonged period of time;Muk;88
Muk can have the ability Stench or the ability Sticky Hold;Muk;88
Stench decreases the chances of encountering a wild Pokémon when Muk is the first party Pokémon;Muk;88
Sticky Hold prevents the theft of Muk's held item;Muk;88
Muk has one of the highest attack points of all Poison-type Pokémon, losing only to Toxicroak;Muk;88
Muk is the evolved form of Grimer, evolving at level 38;Muk;88
Muk is a large, sticky, amorphous Pokémon made of living purple sludge;Muk;88
It has two small eyes with beady black pupils;Muk;88
It also has an enormous mouth with a gray tongue and strands of ooze connecting its top and bottom jaws;Muk;88
While it has no visible legs, it does have two arms with three fingers on each hand;Muk;88
However, it typically keeps one hand tucked in while it extends the other hand;Muk;88
Muk is a living biohazard, leaking toxins that instantly kill all plant life it touches;Muk;88
Even it being in close proximity to plants will cause them to wilt and die;Muk;88
Extreme caution is advised in avoiding any contact with this Pokémon, as an accidental brush up can lead to severe sickness;Muk;88
The effects of this Pokémon can leave the landscape barren for three years;Muk;88
It will readily consume nearly any waste or refuse generated by people and Pokémon alike;Muk;88
Muk's body produces a powerful odor that can cause fainting;Muk;88
However, despite the risk Muk's stench contains, some fans of Muk believe its stench is a good thing;Muk;88
Muk can be found in heavily polluted bodies of water, factories and cities, where groups can gather to consume trash that people threw away into the streets;Muk;88
However, Muk's population has declined due to recent environmental improvements and extermination efforts;Muk;88
This has led some to believe that it will go extinct at some point sludge ponds are being built to prevent its extinction;Muk;88
Alolan Muk has a more vibrant coloration, consisting of green, pink, and yellow stripes with thin blue bands in-between;Muk;88
The green, yellow, and pink stripes are capable of shifting downwards while the blue stays in place;Muk;88
It has various white, crystallized poison shards protruding from parts of its body, especially from its mouth and fingers, giving the impression of claws and fangs;Muk;88
It has blue eyes with a black space behind them and a bright blue tongue;Muk;88
Its vivid coloration is a result of the garbage it eats, which causes chemical changes in its body;Muk;88
Its body contains over a hundred different kinds of poisons;Muk;88
Alolan Muk is unexpectedly quiet and friendly;Muk;88
However, if it is not fed trash for a while, its hunger will compel it to destroy its Trainer's furnishings for food;Muk;88
It is thought that it cannot maintain its energy without a constant source of toxins, which causes its voracious appetite;Muk;88
The crystals covering its body have a tendency to break off, which makes it extremely difficult to deal with due to the concentrated toxins contained within them;Muk;88
Unlike Kantonian Muk, Alolan Muk does not produce a foul stench due to its toxins being contained within its body;Muk;88
1 Alolan Muk preys on Trubbish and Garbodor;Muk;88
Shellder is protected by its two large shells;Shellder;89
Its large tongue is always kept hanging out;Shellder;89
It has two large eyes inside the shell;Shellder;89
Shellder live on the sea floor, digging holes with their tongues and hiding in them with their tongues out to catch prey;Shellder;89
Their tongues are never withdrawn, even when sleeping;Shellder;89
Yanking on them will cause them to open up in shock;Shellder;89
Shellder can move surprisingly quickly by flapping their shells;Shellder;89
They can also lampoon prey with Icicle Spear;Shellder;89
Shellder enjoy eating Slowpoke tail secretions and will bite these tails on sight;Shellder;89
They then adopt a spiral shape and inject poison as the Slowpoke evolve into Slowbro;Shellder;89
They are also oddly attracted to King’s Rocks;Shellder;89
If a Slowpoke is wearing one, a Shellder may propel itself into the air to bite its head, triggering its evolution into a Slowking;Shellder;89
Shellder can have the ability Shell Armor or the ability Skill Link;Shellder;89
Shell Armor prevents Shellder's opponents from getting a Critical Hit on Shellder;Shellder;89
Skill Link increases the frequency of multi-hitting attacks;Shellder;89
As a last resort, Shellder clamps on to its opponents;Shellder;89
It swims backward by opening and closing its two shells;Shellder;89
It is said (in the anime in-game Pokédex entries) that if a Shellder clamps onto a Slowpoke's tail, the Slowpoke will evolve into Slowbro (the Shellder changes shape with it);Shellder;89
Also if a Shellder clamps on Slowpoke's head while wearing a King's Rock, the Slowpoke will evolve into a Slowking;Shellder;89
According to Slowking's Pokédex entries, when the Slowpoke's head is bitten, toxins enter the Slowpoke's head (and into its brain), unlocking extraordinary power and triggering evolution;Shellder;89
These same toxins also causes a Slowbro to no longer be able to feel pain;Shellder;89
According to Slowbro Slowking's Pokédex entries, the Shellder's produce toxins that affect either their victims brain (in Slowking's case) or their nervous system (in Slowbro's case);Shellder;89
It is also said that if a Slowbro's or Slowking's Shellder is removed or detached it (Slowbro/Slowking) will revert (devolve) back to a regular Slowpoke;Shellder;89
Also, it is said that Shellder's tend to latch on to a Slowpoke if it is holding a King's Rock (a reference to Slowking's requirements for evolving);Shellder;89
Upon the Slowpoke's evolution, the Shellder changes it form into either Slowbro's shell (attached to Slowbro's tail) or a Slowking's crown;Shellder;89
In its crown form, the Shellder eyes are located on it backside (which can be easily seen by the player character when a Slowking is used in battle), basically giving Slowking eyes in the back of its head;Shellder;89
Shellder are known to be prey for many Pokémon such as Kingler, which use their giant claws, Omastar, which use their fangs, Rufflet, which use their talons, and Bruxish, which use their teeth all to crack open its shell;Shellder;89
Shellder evolves into Cloyster by use of a Water Stone;Shellder;89
Shellder is a bivalve mollusk Pokémon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell;Shellder;89
It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils;Shellder;89
Its enormously long red tongue is used to burrow itself into the sand to sleep overnight and also to lure and capture prey;Shellder;89
The tongue protrudes even when its shell is closed and tugging it will cause the shell to pop open;Shellder;89
Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields;Shellder;89
It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way;Shellder;89
Shellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon;Shellder;89
After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together;Shellder;89
Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking;Shellder;89
These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle;Shellder;89
In Galar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively;Shellder;89
Regardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers;Shellder;89
Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell;Shellder;89
In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell;Shellder;89
While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain;Shellder;89
This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase;Shellder;89
Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns;Shellder;89
However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body;Shellder;89
Prior to Generation III, Clamp was its signature move;Shellder;89
In Generations III and IV, Icicle Spear was its signature move;Shellder;89
Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts;Shellder;89
Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort;Shellder;89
It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward;Shellder;89
Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell;Shellder;89
Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Gastrodon;Shellder;89
Kingler, Rufflet, and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder;Shellder;89
Cloyster is actually a black pearl within two shells;Cloyster;90
The first shell is purple and rugged, while the second shell is gray;Cloyster;90
When the second shell is opened, a spike is revealed;Cloyster;90
Its face has a cruel look upon it;Cloyster;90
To catch food, Cloyster wait on the ocean floor for prey swim by before shooting these spikes by using the move Spike Cannon;Cloyster;90
The harpooned prey then slowly float down to the waiting Cloyster;Cloyster;90
Like Shellder, Cloyster love Slowpoke tails, and may even venture onto land to seek them out;Cloyster;90
Cloyster are capable of swimming by swallowing water and jetting it out—this is the same process they use to shoot spikes;Cloyster;90
They can slam their shells shut with incredible force;Cloyster;90
Unlike Shellder, Cloyster can use clamping as a viable method of defense;Cloyster;90
Their insides are virtually untouchable while their shells are closed;Cloyster;90
Even the strongest forces cannot pry a clamped Cloyster apart consequently, no one knows exactly what lies within their shells;Cloyster;90
It has been recently discovered that Cloyster that live in stronger currents have larger spikes, though the reason behind this is unknown;Cloyster;90
A concurrent study found that when a Cloyster shell is damaged, a new spike grows in place of the damaged area instead of recovering the flat surface;Cloyster;90
Cloyster's shell is extremely solid;Cloyster;90
It fights by keeping its shell tightly shut for protection, and by shooting spikes to repel foes;Cloyster;90
Cloyster is the evolved form of Shellder by use of a Water Stone;Cloyster;90
Cloyster is a black bivalve mollusk Pokémon;Cloyster;90
It is encased inside a light-gray shell, which is surrounded by a second jagged, blue-violet outer shell casing;Cloyster;90
It has one barb-like spike protruding from above its head, and multiple conical horns on its outer shell;Cloyster;90
Its shell is harder than a diamond with spikes that are even harder harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes;Cloyster;90
On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth;Cloyster;90
Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen;Cloyster;90
Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside;Cloyster;90
This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike;Cloyster;90
Cloyster typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent;Cloyster;90
However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed;Cloyster;90
With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled;Cloyster;90
In Generation I, Clamp was its signature move;Cloyster;90
The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming;Cloyster;90
It swallows seawater and then ejects it towards the rear, pushing it through with siphon-jet propulsion;Cloyster;90
Being the result of Shellder evolving through an Evolution stone, Cloyster is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found on the sea floor, nestled among the rocks and coral however, it will actively hunt on land for Slowpoke tails;Cloyster;90
Cloyster and its pre-evolved form, Shellder, are relatives of Gastrodon;Cloyster;90
Kingler is a natural predator of Cloyster;Cloyster;90
Gastly's appearance consists of a dark sphere (its head) surrounded by light purple gas;Gastly;91
Gastly has large, white eyes and a large mouth with a small pair of fangs;Gastly;91
They capture prey by enveloping them in their poisonous gas, which can seep through skin and cause fainting;Gastly;91
They may also immobilize prey with the paralyzing move Lick;Gastly;91
Despite their poor reputation, though, Gastly are not blatantly malicious and do not “haunt” beings with the intent of harming them;Gastly;91
Instead, they are mischievous pranksters who enjoy startling others;Gastly;91
They rarely utilize their poisonous gases unless threatened, but are known to put victims to sleep with Hypnosis;Gastly;91
Their pranks can be annoying at times, so it should be noted that oscillating fans are very effective at warding Gastly away because the Pokémon steer clear of strong winds;Gastly;91
When Gastly are near, it is said the air will smell faintly sweet;Gastly;91
Due to having a body made of gas, Gastly can slip into any place it wants;Gastly;91
However, Gastly's body will dwindle away when exposed to a strong wind;Gastly;91
It can also render itself nearly invisible and approach enemies undetected, and can envelop said enemies, regardless of their size;Gastly;91
Due to the fact that Gastly's body can be blown away by strong wind, they gather under the eaves of houses in order to escape it;Gastly;91
Gastly has no true form, due to 95% of its body being poisonous gas, with the other 5% believed to be made up of the souls of those who died from the gas;Gastly;91
However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical Pokémon surrounded by a purple haze;Gastly;91
Gastly has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs;Gastly;91
Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them;Gastly;91
It produces a faint, sweet smell;Gastly;91
The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size;Gastly;91
Gastly's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence;Gastly;91
The anime suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun;Gastly;91
However, it has shown a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans;Gastly;91
It has further been shown changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses;Gastly;91
Gastly can be found in caves, but the anime has shown it living in old, dilapidated buildings as well;Gastly;91
Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind;Gastly;91
It may also cause flickering lights in abandoned houses;Gastly;91
In Generation I, Night Shade was its signature move;Gastly;91
Haunter is a purple, spiky, floating figure with triangular eyes, tiny pupils, fangs and disembodied, three-fingered, clawed hands;Haunter;92
They feed on the life force of living things, waiting in the darkness for unwary prey to wander by;Haunter;92
Then, they sneak up on their victims and lick them;Haunter;92
This causes uncontrollable shuddering in their prey, who are slowly drained of life until they die;Haunter;92
Like Gastly, Haunter are also pranksters;Haunter;92
They may trip unwary travelers or place ghostly hands on their shoulders to scare them;Haunter;92
When a Haunter is around, those nearby feel paranoid, as if they are being watched (which they are);Haunter;92
Haunter can also feed on fear;Haunter;92
Though research has shown that such a diet is not very energy-efficient, it is believed that some Haunter have learned to feed on these feelings because they are “sustainable ” by not killing victims, some Haunter have successfully used cities as “farms” of sorts, scaring people as necessary and feeding on their fright;Haunter;92
Many ghost “hot-spots” are in fact popular Haunter feeding grounds;Haunter;92
Since Haunter detest light, well-lit towns are usually devoid of them;Haunter;92
In some regions is said that Haunter come out on moonless nights looking for victims to lay curses on;Haunter;92
Haunter can pass through solid walls;Haunter;92
It is because of this that it is believed it is from another dimension;Haunter;92
It can also sap away the life force of a target by licking them with its tongue;Haunter;92
These licks will always cause constant convulsions to a licked being until it dies;Haunter;92
Haunter is a purple Pokémon with a gaseous body;Haunter;92
It has a round head flanked by three large, spiked protrusions on either side;Haunter;92
It has triangular eyes with small pupils and a mouth with a long, pink tongue;Haunter;92
The gases composing its head curve into its mouth to form several pointed teeth;Haunter;92
Disembodied hands with three clawed fingers each float in front of its body;Haunter;92
Its body tapers into a jagged tail;Haunter;92
Haunter's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence;Haunter;92
Haunter hides in very dark places, such as caves, and is afraid of light;Haunter;92
If a human or a Pokémon comes near Haunter, it will stalk the victim while floating and beckon it to come closer;Haunter;92
Once approached it will then lick the victim with its gaseous tongue, inflicting convulsions in the victim that last until death;Haunter;92
It can also float through walls;Haunter;92
It has been shown in the anime that it can control its hands from far away and can control any Pokémon that it touches with its hands;Haunter;92
Despite its predatory nature, it has been known to entertain and prank people in the anime;Haunter;92
Additionally, it has even been shown to feel intense loyalty to a deceased Trainer;Haunter;92
In Generation I, Night Shade was its signature move;Haunter;92
Gengar is a shadow-like, round-bodied Pokémon with two large, pointed ears and short spikes lining its back;Gengar;93
Gengar has two red eyes and a toothy, sinister smile;Gengar;93
It has claws on its hands;Gengar;93
Gengar stands on its two short legs, but it can Levitate as well;Gengar;93
In Mega Gengar, it has a hot pink smoke around it, and it has a 3rd yellow eye, its hands are buried in the ground, it also got more spikes in its back and tail;Gengar;93
In Gigantamax Gengar, it has grown much larger, its red eyes turned yellow with soulless white pupils, the body hasn't changed much, but there is no physical feet visible, its hands are detached and in the ground, its mouth also looks like some sort of room, with a long tongue inside;Gengar;93
Gengar are typically mean-spirited and enjoy tormenting people, hurting them and overtaking them;Gengar;93

Weezing is formed from a fusion of toxic gases and two Koffings for many years;Weezing;109
Because of the constant mixtures of poison gases within its body, Weezing always emit foul-smelling odors;Weezing;109
Just like its pre-evolved form, Weezing is able to hover in the air;Weezing;109
Despite smelling horrible, the gases that Weezing creates have been used for perfumes;Weezing;109
Weezing is fond of garbage and other sources of pollution it is mainly nocturnal, always looking for trash from a human's house;Weezing;109
The gases produced from a Kantonian Weezing is much more potent than the gases from a Galarian Weezing;Weezing;109
Galarian Weezing relies on poisonous gases to sustain itself;Weezing;109
Unlike its Kantonian counterpart, Galarian Weezing emits clean purified air rather than pollution;Weezing;109

The toxins Galarian Weezing stores inside its body are released into the air as concentrated poisonous gas, which is so lethal that a mere whiff will immobilize anyone caught in its vicinity;Weezing;109
This toxic gas is apparently Galarian Weezing's best weapon to use in battle;Weezing;109

Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare;Weezing;109
Each of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin;Weezing;109
It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other;Weezing;109
When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid;Weezing;109
Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing;Weezing;109
Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level;Weezing;109
Weezing lives in urban areas;Weezing;109
It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there;Weezing;109
At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash;Weezing;109
Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste;Weezing;109
Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases;Weezing;109
The Kantonian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives;Weezing;109

It has a gray body with the skull, crossbones, and ring patterns changed to the color yellow;Weezing;109
Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly releases purified air;Weezing;109
Five puffs of green poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it;Weezing;109
The gas clouds also partly cover its faces: the larger head has a mustache-like cloud on its upper lip, while the smaller head has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard;Weezing;109
Galarian Weezing consumes particles from polluted air, and expels clean air instead of droppings;Weezing;109
The toxins within Galarian Weezing's body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leaks and drifts around it;Weezing;109
The gas is its best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff;Weezing;109
1 Galarian Weezing preys on Trubbish for the fumes it produces;Weezing;109

Its arms are brown;Staryu;119
It seems to have some kind of crystal or gem for a core;Staryu;119
The core is surrounded by a yellow or gold barrier;Staryu;119
Staryu are mysterious Pokémon that lie on the seabed during the day and float up to the surface at night;Staryu;119
For this reason, Pokémon like Lumineon often nibble on them as a reliable source of food;Staryu;119
Even a Staryu cut into pieces can regenerate as long as its core is intact;Staryu;119
Their centers are vital to their survival and are irreplaceable;Staryu;119
These cores glow brightly at night when Staryu are active, whereas the cores of sick Staryu glow faintly and flicker;Staryu;119

If any of Staryu's appendages are lost or eaten by predators like Lumineon, it is unharmed and can grow them back with ease provided the core is still intact;Staryu;119
When the sun goes down, the core glows its brightest;Staryu;119
Many Staryu will float from the seafloor to the surface and align themselves with stars of the night sky as their core flickers, displaying a connection with the celestial bodies of space;Staryu;119

It appears to have more than five appendages;Starmie;120
Interestingly Starmie's back-half has been depicted several different ways;Starmie;120
In the anime Starmie has the appearance of two starfish fused together while in more modern games the back-half has been shown to spin wildly completely independent of the front-half of the Pokémon;Starmie;120
Many fans tend to think of the anime's depiction as the more realistic of the two, considering the rapid spinning would obviously get in the way of any trainer trying to surf on this particular Pokémon;Starmie;120
Starmie's core shines in a rainbow of seven colors, some people value this core as a type of jewelry;Starmie;120
They can flash their gems in a single color, alternating between different shades as if sending coded messages;Starmie;120

The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees;Starmie;120
This rotational action is how Starmie swims through the ocean;Starmie;120
It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in Pokémon Snap;Starmie;120
From its core, Starmie can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe;Starmie;120
The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication with other members of its species;Starmie;120
As seen in the anime, the core will go dark if Starmie is knocked unconscious and will sometimes flicker if Starmie is low on health;Starmie;120
Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pokémon to be extraterrestrial;Starmie;120
It is rarely seen in the wild since it requires a rare Evolution stone to evolve, but it can be found in the deepest parts of the ocean;Starmie;120
It feeds by absorbing tiny plankton into its body while swimming, and it is preyed on by Lumineon;Starmie;120
