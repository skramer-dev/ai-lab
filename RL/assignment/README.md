In this assignment we're building a DQN Agent for atari games.

Our game of choice is Atlantis (though we've used Pong during development, see history for more details)

# Game description: Atlantis (1982)

The player controls three turrets. They are located on the left edge of the screen, one in the middle of the screen and one on the right edge of the screen.

The goal of the game is to destroy the approaching spaceships with the turrets. In the process, the shots from the towers on the edge fly diagonally into the center. The turret in the center shoots in a straight line into the sky. The spaceships fly from one edge of the screen to the other, and when they reach a level they can fly closer to Atlantis. At a certain height, the spaceships can destroy the buildings of Atlantis.

The game ends when all buildings of Atlantis are destroyed.
